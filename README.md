## 1. Project Description
The **FamilyTree** application is a Java-based project aimed at digitally modeling and managing complex family relationships. It processes structured data from an external CSV file (**input.csv**), which contains information about individuals and their familial connections (spousal, parent-child). The application's core functionality involves parsing this data to build an in-memory representation of a family tree, enabling various operations such as navigating relationships and potentially querying specific family members or lineages. This project serves as an excellent foundation for understanding data parsing, object-oriented design, and graph data structures in Java.

## 2. Key Features
* **CSV Data Parsing:** Reads and interprets familial data from a structured *input.csv* file.
* **Dynamic Family Tree Construction:** Builds an interconnected data structure representing individuals and their relationships.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes *Person* and *Tree* classes to model individuals and the overall family structure, promoting modular and maintainable code.
* **Relationship Mapping:** Accurately identifies and stores spousal and parent-child relationships.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to be easily expandable for future features, such as querying specific relationships, displaying the tree, or adding new data sources.

## 3. Data Source
The application relies on *input.csv* as its primary data source. This file must be located in the root directory of the project. It contains two types of entries: individual declarations (Name, Gender) and relationship declarations (Individual1, RelationshipType, Individual2).

**Baratheon Family Dataset Summary**

The current *input.csv* details the following individuals and their relationships.

## 4. Setup Instructions
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 4.1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or 11.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** NetBeans IDE (8.0+) or IntelliJ IDEA (Community/Ultimate).

### 4.2. General Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

> git clone
> 
> cd FamilyTree

2. Place *input.csv*: Ensure the *input.csv* file is located in the root directory of the cloned *FamilyTree* folder.

### 4.3. IDE-Specific Setup
The project's source code is located in the src folder of this repository. The most reliable way to integrate it into your IDE is to replace the default src contents generated by your IDE with the provided project source code.

**4.3.1. NetBeans IDE**
1. **Create New Project:**
* Open NetBeans.
* Go to *File > New Project....*
* Select *Java with Ant* (or *Java with Maven/Gradle* if using a build tool) then *Java Application*.
* Click *Next*.
* For *Project Name*, enter *FamilyTree*.
* Ensure *Create Main Class* is checked.
* Click *Finish*.
2. **Close NetBeans:** Close NetBeans IDE completely.
3. **Replace *src* Contents:**
* Navigate to your newly created NetBeans project folder (e.g., *C:\Users\YourUser\NetBeansProjects\FamilyTree).*
* Delete all contents within the *src* folder (e.g., *FamilyTree\src\*).
* Copy the *src* folder from your cloned GitHub repository (e.g., *FamilyTree-repo\src\*) into your NetBeans project's root directory (e.g., *FamilyTree\*). This will place the project's source code, including *FamilyTree.java* and the *classes* package, into the correct location.
4. **Reopen NetBeans:** Open NetBeans IDE.
5. **Run the Project:**
* In the *Projects* window, expand *FamilyTree > Source Packages*.
* Locate *FamilyTree.java*.
* Right-click *FamilyTree.java* and select *Run File*. If prompted to set it as the main class, select OK.
### 4.3.2. IntelliJ IDEA
1. **Create New Project:**
* Open IntelliJ IDEA.
* Select *New Project.*
* Choose *Java* (or *Maven/Gradle* if using a build tool) from the left sidebar.
* Click *Next.*
* For *Project name*, enter *FamilyTree*.
* Ensure the correct JDK is selected.
* Click *Finish*.
2. **Refactor Main Class (if needed):** If IntelliJ generated a default main class (e.g., *Main.java*) and your main entry point is *FamilyTree.java*, you might need to refactor the generated class name to *FamilyTree* or configure *FamilyTree.java* as the main run configuration.
3. **Close IntelliJ:** Close IntelliJ IDEA completely.
4. **Replace *src* Contents:**
* Navigate to your newly created IntelliJ project folder (e.g., *C:\Users\YourUser\IdeaProjects\FamilyTree).*
* Delete all contents within the *src* folder (e.g., *FamilyTree\src\*).
* Copy the *src* folder from your cloned GitHub repository (e.g., *FamilyTree-repo\src\*) into your IntelliJ project's root directory (e.g., *FamilyTree\*). This will place the project's source code, including *FamilyTree.java* and the *classes* package, into the correct location.
5. **Open IntelliJ:** Open IntelliJ IDEA and open the FamilyTree project folder.
6. **Run the Program:**
* In the *Project* tool window, navigate to *src* and locate *FamilyTree.java.*
* Right-click *FamilyTree.java* and select *Run 'FamilyTree.main()'.*
### 4.4. Troubleshooting
* **FileNotFoundException:** Ensure *input.csv* is directly in the root of your project folder (same level as src).
* **ClassNotFoundException** / Package Issues:
  * Verify that you have correctly copied the *src* folder from the repository, ensuring all Java files (especially *Person.java* and *Tree.java* within the classes package) are present.
  * Rebuild your project in the IDE (*Build > Rebuild Project* in IntelliJ, *Clean and Build Project* in NetBeans).
  * Check your IDE's module settings to ensure the *src* folder is marked as a "Sources Root."
* **IDE Not Recognizing Files:** If, after copying, the IDE doesn't highlight Java files correctly, try closing and reopening the IDE, or refreshing the project structure.

## 5. Usage
Once the project is successfully set up and compiled:
* **Run the *FamilyTree.java* main class.**
* The application will read data from *input.csv.*
  * Expected output  include a confirmation of successful data loading, a list of individuals, or a demonstration of relationship queries.

## 6. Contributing
We welcome contributions to the *FamilyTree* project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaborative process:
* **Branching Strategy:** We use a feature-branch workflow.
  * Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix: *git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name or git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description.*
  * Base your new branch off the *main* branch.
* **Code Style:** Adhere to standard Java code conventions (e.g., Google Java Format or Oracle's Code Conventions). Maintain consistent indentation, naming conventions, and commenting practices.
* **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages. Use the present tense and explain what the commit does, not what you did. (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").
* **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  * Submit a Pull Request to the *main* branch when your feature or bug fix is complete.
  * Provide a clear description of the changes, why they were made, and any relevant issue numbers.
  * Ensure your code passes all existing tests and consider adding new tests for new functionality.
* **Issue Reporting:** If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
